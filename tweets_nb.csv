We support responsible mining & refining.

Specifically:

- We source directly from mining & refining companies. Avoiding the middleman enables more transparent & easily traceable supply chain data.

- We use external mining initiatives & expect suppliers to undergo independent audits.

In addition, vertical integration & regionalization help us have more control over supply.

2022 Highlights

Last year, our customers avoided releasing about 13.4 million metric tons of CO2e into our atmosphere 🌎

Tesla vehicle emissions are significantly lower vs ICE vehicles. This will continue to improve as the grid gets cleaner, while the carbon impact of ICE vehicles remains the same every year.

After 17 years of driving—the average life of a vehicle in the US—a single Tesla will avoid almost 55 tons of CO2e.

Also, the Supercharger network continues to be 100% renewable. This was achieved via onsite resources & annual renewable matching.",422,7493,119,1595924.0,,1278,1650587499947864067

Highlights

In Q1, Giga Berlin achieved a production rate of 5k Model Y/week.

Cybertruck equipment installation continued in Q1, with production remaining on track to start later this year.

We achieved 44% growth in vehicle production & 36% growth in deliveries YoY, despite Q1 historically being the most challenging quarter for the auto industry.

Giga Shanghai has been successfully running near full capacity for several months & remains our main export hub.

Energy storage deployments increased by 360% YoY to 3.9 GWh—by far the highest level we have achieved.

We’re rapidly growing energy storage production capacity at our Megafactory in Lathrop.
